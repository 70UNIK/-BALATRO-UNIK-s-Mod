# UNIK's Mod!
An addon to Cryptid that adds a variety of features, some of which help and some of which are harmful.
This is mainly balanced around the Mainline gameset of Cryptid, and around various vanilla (or vanilla adjacent modded decks), where some challenge is provided.

Requires Talisman, Steamodded 1.0.0~BETA-0309c or higher, Lovely v0.7.1 and Cryptid v0.5.6 or higher.

I'll focus on fixing some issues that may arise, adding more art and making more fusions and fusion art for that certain mod.
Due to the way it has been programmed, there may be some compatibility issues with other mods (although I have programmed some compatibility fixes for some mods)

------
Pretty much all artwork is done by me and most of the code is mainly of my conception, although various ideas on Blinds, Characters and code are derived from others
