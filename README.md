# UNIK's Mod!
A standalone mod that adds what I want. It is unbalanced compared to Vanilla though more tame compared with Cryptid.

Right now it is in a WIP stage of becoming a standalone, so expect placeholder art as well as potential bugs.

Requires Steamodded smods-1.0.0-beta-0827c or higher, Lovely v0.7.1 or higher. Talisman can be used to increase the scoring cap but isnt necessarily required.

While most of my artwork is done by me, art for the Spectrum-based Jokers and Planets are from Bunco and most of the code is mainly of my conception, although various ideas on Blinds, Characters and code are derived from others
