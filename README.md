# UNIK's Mod!
An addon to Cryptid that adds a variety of features, some of which help and some of which are harmful.
This is mainly balanced around the Mainline gameset of Cryptid, and around various vanilla (or vanilla adjacent modded decks), where some challenge is provided.

Requires Steamodded smods-1.0.0-beta-0711a or higher, Lovely v0.7.1 and Cryptid v0.5.10~dev3 or higher. Talisman can be used to increase the scoring cap but isnt necessarily required.
It is recommended though to use smods-1.0.0-beta-0711a and Cryptid Balanced Branch, more specifically https://github.com/SpectralPack/Cryptid/tree/99df47a6f6c769ab7f1fdf81ebf3575f6bf2f1e3.
