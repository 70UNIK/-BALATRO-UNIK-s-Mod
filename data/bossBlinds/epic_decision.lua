--EPIC DECISION:
--Upon entering the blind:
--Open an ultra baneful booster pack:
--Choose 4 of 8 horrible consumeable effects (called Lartceps):
--Cannot be skipped at all.
--- Hellspawn: Add 20 Cursed Jokers. Temporarily create a Showman in the process. (Default)
--- Placard: Add Absolute and Rental to all Jokers, 50% chance to add Banana, 25% chance to add Perishable, 10% chance to add Niko
--- Wipe (styled as a code card): Destroy all but 1 card in the deck
--- Garbage: Add random cards equal to 2x your deck size
--- Sinners: The next 4 Boss Blinds will become Epic+ Blinds. 
--- Trim (styled as a code card): Set Joker slots to 0 (Almanac)/Remove all empty joker slots (Cryptid)
--- Reeducation: All your Jokers, Cards and Consumeables become Positive.
--- Expulsion: Randomly banish 66% of owned Jokers, eternals included
--- Extortion: Set money to -$666.
--- Escalation: Ante^1.5, tension^1.5, straddle^1.5, rounded up.
--- Summit: Increases next blind/current blind size by ^^2.
--- The Single (Styled as a tarot): Set hand size to 1.
--- Bretheren Moon (Styled as a planet): Remove all bonuses and set all hand levels to 0. 
--- Powerdown: Destroy 50% of jokers, cards, consumeables and halve all levels (rounded down). Art is MX ripping GF in 2
--- Expiry: Unredeem all vouchers
-- Likewise, Lartceps are always eternal and rental and always have the positive edition (reservia counter)
