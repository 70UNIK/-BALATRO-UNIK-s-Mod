--EPIC DECISION:
--Upon entering the blind:
--Open a Lartceps Bundle pack (choose 5 from 10):
--Cannot be skipped at all.
--- Hellspawn: Add 20 Cursed Jokers. Temporarily create a Showman in the process. (Default)
--- Placard: All cards are permenantly debuffed then destroy all undebuffed cards
--- Wipe (styled as a code card): Destroy all but 1 card in the deck
--- Garbage: Add random cards equal to 2x your deck size
--- Sinners: The next 4 Boss Blinds will become Epic+ Blinds. 
--- Trim (styled as a code card): Set Joker slots to 0 (Almanac)/Remove empty joker slots then halve joker slots (Cryptid)
--- Reeducation: All your Jokers, Cards and Consumeables become Positive.
--- Expulsion: Randomly banish 66% of owned Jokers, eternals included
--- Extortion: Set money to -$666.
--- Escalation: Ante^1.5, tension^1.5, straddle^1.5, rounded up.
--- Summit: Increases next blind/current blind size by ^^2.
--- The Single (Styled as a tarot): Set hand size to 1.
--- Bretheren Moon (Styled as a planet): Remove all bonuses and set all hand levels to 0. 
--- Powerdown: Destroy 50% of jokers, cards, consumeables and halve all levels (rounded down). Art is MX ripping GF in 2
--- Mouth of Sauron: Add "matla" unhancement to 50% of cards in deck (create a lartceps on trigger, then self destructs)
--- Expiry: Unredeem all vouchers
--- Blank Larceps (almanac exclusive): copies and automatically triggers the last lartceps used
-- Likewise, Lartceps are always eternal and rental and always have the positive edition (reservia counter). They will also have a "triggering" sticker (1 in 2 chance to be used at the start of blind)
